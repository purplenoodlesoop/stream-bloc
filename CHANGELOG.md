### Changed
- Bumped `bloc` and `meta` dependencies.

- Refactored `StreamBlocBase` – improved code style and enforced DRY principle.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `listenToStreamable` and `reactToStreamable` methods of `BlocLifecycleMixin`, as [Streamable-to-Streamable communications are discouraged](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/architecture?id=bloc-to-bloc-communication).

### Removed
- Removed exports of `BlocObserver`, `BlocOverrides`, `Cubit`, `Emitter`, `EventHandler` from `bloc` package.
